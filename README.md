# ❄️ Anthropic-in-Snowflake Cortex

## Overview
I built an RAG-based (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application that serves as an intelligent assistant for documents and text-based knowledge. Using Anthropic's Claude LLM inside Snowflake's Cortex AI, I integrated Cortex Search and Streamlit to create a seamless, interactive experience.

As part of this end-to-end solution, I handled everything from PDF processing and vector embedding to retrieval and generation, all fully contained within Snowflake. This allowed me to enable natural language interactions with documents, leveraging Claude’s advanced language understanding, all while maintaining unified governance across the entire stack.
